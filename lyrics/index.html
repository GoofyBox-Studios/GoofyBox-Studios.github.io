			Lyrics for One Day
		</h1>
		<pre style="font-size: 20px;">
			One in a day, when I was crushing my math,
			I had a bottle of pepsi, and my favorite calculator,
			I rose from my chair, you should try and guess what I saw,
			Saw a couple of ladies, driving red cars. (Ooh, got em!)
			
			Birds go flying when you shoot with your gun,
			If your in the back seat, you won't be driving so well,
			My phone ran out of battery while I was texting myself,
			Because it once got a charger, but it isn't working anymore.
			
			And
			One day, I'll go back to the store,
			Pay some money, and get a new charger,
			I'll pay all my taxes, for once in my life,
			And I'll ace all my tests, and find those lost keys.
			
			*Screaming noises*

			<h1>
				Proper Pronciation
			</h1>
			One day, I was crusin' along,
			Had a bottle of juice, and me favorite song,
			I turned me head, you'll never guess what I saw,
			Saw a couple of pidgeons, cruising along. (Ooh, Ooh!)
			
			Pigs come flying as they shoot for the starts,
			If your in the back seat, then I'll see you at Mars,
			Glow a little brighter for the people next door,
			'Cause they once got a candle, it 'aint glowin' no more.
			
			And
			One day, they'll be nedin' ya most,
			But ya wen' on a date, wit' somebody's toast,
			She's begun to mold, and she's got da flu,
			And yer ego so big, dat I brought 'im too.
			
			*Breathing noises*
